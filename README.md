LiteMonitor v0.3
============
Now Supports MMPool.org & Doge.HashFaster.com In A Multi-Pool Switching Model

I've explained all of the user controls inside of the main program and given the option to control pool switching via Android GUI Prompt.

Down &amp; Dirty Crypto Pool: Miner Status Display [Via Consolidated Web-API]

This is a Beta release. I know it works on Doge.Hashfast's pool.

1) Under Your Pool Settings > My Account > Click Your API-Key Link

2) Copy URL

3) On Google Play Store > Download QPython

4) Install Script in the 'Scripts' folder

5) Paste URL in Designated Section

6) Edit minerVar = #Value to set automated message stream

7) Save your edit

8) Go back to main screen

9) Click the big circle and Run Scripts & select the Program

It run flawlessly for me while I am at work and need to check my stats really quick. I have only tested it with the one pool right now. 

I wrote it as an alternetive to other Monitor App's that don't work, and out of fear of viruses on the PlayStore.

Source is commented and easy to read so you can see what it is doing.

Enjoy :)
